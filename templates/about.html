    <h1>Who I Am</h1>
    <p>I'm an 18-year-old developer with a diploma in Computer Engineering, focused on building efficient digital
        solutions through Python and machine learning.</p>
    <p>I enjoy working independently on real-world projects — from automation tools and backend systems to intelligent
        apps that solve meaningful problems. With a strong drive for financial and creative freedom, I'm constantly
        learning, building, and refining my skills to work smarter and create value through code.</p>

    <h1>What I'm Working Toward</h1>
    <p>Right now, I'm focused on sharpening my full-stack development and ML skills by building real-world projects. I'm
        preparing to take on freelance gigs and collaborate on remote tech work that challenges my problem-solving and
        creativity.</p>
    <p>Alongside building projects, I'm sharpening my skills in data structures, algorithms, and AI. My goal is to not
        just write code—but to solve problems intelligently and design systems that adapt, learn, and scale.</p>
