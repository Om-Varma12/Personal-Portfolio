    <h1>Who I Am</h1>
    <p>I'm a 19-year-old developer with a diploma in Computer Engineering and currently pursuing a B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. 
        I'm passionate about building intelligent digital solutions that combine data, automation, and real-world impact.</p>

    <p>I enjoy working independently on diverse projects — from AI-powered systems and automation tools to full-fledged data-driven applications. 
        With a strong ambition to become a Data Scientist, I'm continuously learning, experimenting, and refining my craft to create meaningful value 
        through technology.</p>

    <h1>What I'm Working Toward</h1>
    <p>Right now, I'm focused on sharpening my full-stack development and ML skills by building real-world projects. I'm
        preparing to take on freelance gigs and collaborate on remote tech work that challenges my problem-solving and
        creativity.</p>
    <p>Alongside building projects, I'm sharpening my skills in data structures, algorithms, and AI. My goal is to not
        just write code—but to solve problems intelligently and design systems that adapt, learn, and scale.</p>
